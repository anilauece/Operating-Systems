							1 Introduction to the linux kernel
History of unix:
----------------
1969: Bell lab programmers sketched out a file-system design that evolved iinto Unix.
Unix design is simple, straight forward and basic design.
Only 100's of system-calls(not 1000's of system calls)
unix is distributed with source code. source accessible to many developers.
Everything is a file(except Sockets).
-> Changing data and device using same API's
-> (open(), close(), read(), write(), lseek())
Unix is written in C. So, portability is good across different h/w architectures.
Unix has fast process creation time
-> unique fork() system call
Unix has robust IPC(interprocess communication)

Unix has single purpose programs. Multiple single purpose programs together can achieve 
complex tasks.
Unix has clean layering.
Unix variants scale to 100's of processors
Unix variants can run on small, embedded devices.
So, unix remain a practical and general purpose OS.

BSD - Variant of Unix.

Features:
csh, vi, Virtual Memory(VM), Job control, Demand Paging, TCP/IP

Modern unix:
------------
1. Preemptive multitasking
2. Multithreading
3. Virtual memory
4. Demand paging
5. Shared libs with demand loading
6. TCP/IP networking

Reason for unix success:
------------------------
1. Simplicity, elegance of it's design.
2. Good inaugural design decisions during unix development helped unix to evolve itself without compromising.

Introduction to Linux:
----------------------
Motivation for Linux Torvalds: Lack of powerful yet "FREE" Unix system.
------------------------------
Linus used Minix(Unix variant)
He can't make changes to os code and distribute them. Reason: 
1. Minix's licensing issues.
2. Design decisions are only made by Minix author.

First Linux Version - 1991 (OS for computers running with Intel 80386 microprocessor).
- Linux quickly attracted many developers, adding, changing, improving code. Because of terms of it's license, Linux swiftly evolved into "collaborative project"
developed by many.
Linux is a collaborative project.

GNOME- full-featured desktop environment.

Operating system: Part of the system responsible for basic use and administration.

Kernel - Software that provides basic services for all other parts of the system, manages hardware and distributes system resources.

Components of Kernel:
---------------------
1. Interrupt handler: To service interrupt requests.
2. Scheduler to share processor time among multiple processes.
3. Memory management system to manage process address spaces.
4. System services: Networking, Interprocess communication(IPC) etc.

Kernel (vs) Userspace apps:
---------------------------
1. Kernel resides in elevated system state compared to normal user apps.
- Elevated system state: Protected Memory Space and full access to Hardware.
2. elevated system state + memory space = kernel-space.
3. User apps run in user-space.

System modes: Kernel mode (vs) user mode
-----------------------------------------
1. When executing kernel code, system is in kernel-space executing in kernel mode.
2. When running regular process, system is in user-space executing in user mode.

system calls:
-------------
1. Apps communicate with Kernel via system calls.
2. applications call into kernel via system call interface
- this is the way applications get work done.

Process context:
-----------------
When application executes a system call, we say that the kernel is executing on behalf of the application:
- Means, application is said to be executing system call in kernel space, kernel is running in process context.
